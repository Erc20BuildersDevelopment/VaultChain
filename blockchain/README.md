# 🛡️ VaultChain Blockchain

Welcome to **VaultChain** — a next-generation blockchain designed for secure, scalable, and community-driven expansion.  
VaultChain empowers users to **mint**, **build**, and **expand** the chain by contributing to its ecosystem.

---

## 🌐 What is VaultChain?

VaultChain is a decentralized blockchain platform where **users actively shape** the chain’s future.  
Each new block minted not only generates VaultChain Tokens (VCT) but also **unlocks possibilities** for further development: smart contracts, decentralized apps, staking mechanisms, and more.

At VaultChain, **you are the architect** of the network.

## 🧱 Core Features

### 1. **Block Minting**
- Mint up to **1,000 VaultChain Tokens (VCT)** per block.
- Minting costs:
  - `0.1 sETH` (Sepolia testnet)  
  - Or `$2000` worth of **ERC20 Builder tokens**.
- **Ownership** of the block is transferred immediately to your wallet.

### 2. **Staking Mechanism**
- Stake your VCT to:
  - Earn passive staking rewards.
  - Participate in governance votes.
  - Access special network privileges (e.g., validator rights).

### 3. **Smart Contract Layer**
- Deploy your own contracts and dApps on top of VaultChain.
- Support for Solidity and EVM-compatible tooling.

### 4. **Governance**
- VaultChain is governed by its contributors.
- Voting rights are proportional to VCT holdings.
- Propose upgrades, improvements, and changes to the protocol.

### 5. **Security Model**
- VaultChain uses a hybrid Proof of Stake + Proof of Ownership model.
- Active validators secure the chain, while block owners act as second-layer validators.
