# 🛠️ VaultChain

**VaultChain** is a **decentralized blockchain** project founded by the **ERC20 Development Team**, built to empower **community-driven block ownership**. Users can **mint**, **own**, and **expand** the network by actively participating — shaping the future of VaultChain block by block.

---

## 🚀 What is VaultChain?

VaultChain is a new kind of blockchain ecosystem designed for **builders, miners, and visionaries**. Rather than relying on centralized systems or rigid protocols, VaultChain gives control to the users — where **every block has an owner**, and **every action contributes to the network**.

---

## 🧱 Core Features

### 1. **Block Minting**
- Mint up to **1,000 VaultChain Tokens (VCT)** per block.
- Minting costs:
  - `0.1 sETH` (on Sepolia testnet)
  - Or `$2000` in **ERC20 Builder tokens**
- Ownership is transferred to your wallet once minted.

### 2. **Block Mining**
- **Mine blocks** that aren't your own using the official `ERC20 Miner` program.
- Earn the full minted VCT + **5% of miner revenue**.
- Encourages fair distribution and active contribution.

### 3. **VaultChain Tokens (VCT)**
- The core utility token of the VaultChain ecosystem.
- Used for rewards, block validation, and future governance utilities.

### 4. **Smart Contract Rewards Pool**
- All minting fees go into a decentralized rewards contract.
- Users can claim rewards using **EIP-712 digital signatures** (via `signature.sol`).
- Signature-based claims are transparent, verifiable, and bonus-enabled.

### 5. **Sync Daemon Support**
- Users can run a VaultChain daemon to connect with peers.
- Enables full-node functionality and helps maintain decentralization.

### 6. **ERC20 NFT Badges**
- Earn official **ERC20 Builders Hub NFTs** for milestones:
  - Mint 10 blocks
  - Mine 1,000 VCT
  - Uptime contributions and more

### 7. **VaultChain Block Explorer** *(Coming Soon 🚧)*
- Visualize block minting history, ownership, revenue, and token mining.
- Realtime sync from the VaultChain repo or daemon-based scanning.
- Open-source, community-contributed.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Solidity** for smart contracts
- **Sepolia Testnet** deployment
- **EIP-712** for secure signature verification
- **Python + Qt or Electron** for block explorer GUI (planned)
- **File-based + Networked P2P model** for syncing

## 🧠 Philosophy

VaultChain is not just a blockchain.  
It's a **living, growing ecosystem** of builders.  
Each block you mint is your contribution to a decentralized digital world.  
Built **by the community**, **for the community**.
