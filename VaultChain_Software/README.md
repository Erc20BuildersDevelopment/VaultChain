# VaultChain Software

This repository contains software created and provided by the official **ERC20 Builders Hub** community for general contribution and usage within the **VaultChain Network**. The software is organized into two main directories: `bin` and `code`. These directories serve different purposes, with `bin` containing compiled software and `code` containing source code for manual editing and execution.

## Directory Structure

```
VaultChain_Software/
├── bin/                # Compiled software (supports multiple versions, generally ready to use)
└── code/               # Source code (to be run manually, often overwritten)
```

## Overview

The **VaultChain Software** is a collection of tools and applications aimed at interacting with and supporting the VaultChain Network. The software is divided into two distinct sections based on the type of content:

### 1. `bin/` - Compiled Software

This directory contains compiled software that is ready to run. The software in this folder supports multiple versions and is most likely packaged for different operating systems and environments. These tools are intended to be used directly without modification. You can run them on your system as they are, and they will usually not require you to interact with the underlying code.

- **Contents**: Compiled executables, binaries, and possibly versioned releases of tools that interact with the VaultChain Network.
- **Usage**: Simply download and run the executables. They may support multiple versions and provide ready-to-use functionalities.
- **Example**: VaultChain daemon, network clients, or other utilities compiled for user convenience.

### 2. `code/` - Source Code

The `code` directory contains raw, uncompiled source code for tools that require manual execution or modification. The source code in this folder is primarily for developers who want to interact with the VaultChain Network or extend the functionalities by modifying the code. This folder does **not support versioning** and is intended for local use, where the user can edit the code as needed.

- **Contents**: Source files for various VaultChain applications and tools. The code in this directory may be overwritten, updated, or edited based on individual needs.
- **Usage**: Open the files in your preferred code editor (such as Visual Studio Code or PyCharm) and run or modify them manually. This code is not intended to be used as a packaged application but rather for experimentation and development.
- **Example**: Python scripts, configuration files, or other custom applications provided in raw format for development.

## How to Use the Software

### 1. Using the Compiled Software (`bin/`)

1. Navigate to the `bin/` directory.
2. Choose the appropriate version for your operating system.
3. Download and run the executable directly from this folder. These are precompiled and should work right away without requiring modifications.

For example, if you have a file like `vaultchain_daemon_v1.0.0.exe` (on Windows), simply run it from the command line or by double-clicking the executable.

### 2. Using the Source Code (`code/`)

1. Navigate to the `code/` directory.
2. Open the desired source file in your preferred code editor.
3. Modify or run the code as needed. Ensure you have any required dependencies installed (e.g., Python, Node.js, etc.), depending on the software.
4. After modifying the code, you may need to compile or execute it manually using the appropriate command (e.g., `python main.py`, `npm start`, etc.).
