# 🌐 VaultChain Network Path

Welcome to the **VaultChain Network Path** repository.  
This system provides **transparent logging** of all user connection events across the VaultChain decentralized network.

---

## 📡 What is the VaultChain Network Path?

The **VaultChain Network Path** is a **real-time connection layer** that monitors and records how users interact with the VaultChain blockchain via the official **VaultChain Daemon**.

It keeps an immutable record of:
- **New connections** from contributors
- **Updates** pushed or requested
- **Activity logs** regarding block minting, staking, governance actions, and smart contract deployments
- **Health metrics** and status reports from active nodes

This ensures **transparency**, **accountability**, and **historical tracking** across the VaultChain network.

Got it — you want it described **more accurately and simply**, based on what **actually happens**.

You’re saying:

- **When the user stops** their VaultChain Daemon,
- **All successful and failed connection logs** are **collected into one file**,
- This file can be **sent to the owner** to **validate** and **reward** the user with VTK (VaultChain Tokens),
- **This file is then published** under the **user’s wallet address** to **prove contribution** to the VaultChain network.

Here’s the corrected and updated version of that section for `network/README.md`:

## 📋 What Gets Logged?

When a user **stops** their **VaultChain Daemon**, the system:

- Collects all **successful** and **failed** connection attempts into **one log file**.
- This log file can be **submitted to the VaultChain owner** for **verification** and **reward** distribution (in VTK).
- After validation, the log file is **published publicly** under the user's **wallet address** as proof of contribution to the network.


| Event Type       | Description                                          |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `CONNECTION_SUCCESS` | Successful connection to the VaultChain network. |
| `CONNECTION_FAIL`    | Failed attempt to connect to the VaultChain network. |


✅ **Important:**  
- Only minimal, necessary metadata is logged (wallet ID, event type, timestamp).  
- Personal/private information is never recorded.

✅ **Rewards:**  
- Users who consistently contribute and submit verified logs are eligible for **VaultChain Token (VTK)** rewards.

## 🔒 Why Are Logs Important?

- 📈 **Transparency**: Anyone can see who is participating and contributing.
- 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**: Helps identify network issues and node irregularities.
- 🛡️ **Security**: Detects anomalies or malicious behavior early.
- 📜 **Historical Record**: Allows tracking VaultChain’s evolution over time.

## ⚙️ How the VaultChain Daemon Interacts

The VaultChain Daemon automatically:
- Connects your node to the network.
- Logs your connection with minimal metadata (wallet ID, action type, timestamp).
- Regularly fetches or pushes updates.
- Ensures your contributions (blocks, stakes, contracts) are recorded.

✅ **Privacy Note**: Only essential, non-sensitive metadata is logged.  
✅ No personal data is stored.

## 🛠️ Setting Up

If you're a node operator or developer:
1. Install the [VaultChain Daemon](#) *(link coming soon)*.
2. Connect your wallet and sync with the VaultChain network.
3. Your activity will be automatically logged through the Network Path.

You can view your own connection logs or the public logs if needed.

## 🚨 Important Policies

- Any attempt to **spam** or **spoof** the network is automatically flagged.
- Abuse or suspicious activities will be publicly visible and can result in **network-wide blacklisting** through governance votes.
- VaultChain maintains a **trust-first** approach but **enforces strong community moderation**.
